# SORTING ALGORITHMS

Why  BIg O

Gives us a simple way to talk about the time and space requirements  of an algorithms 


Better algo saves time enhances better user experience

Better algo saves companies resources

Algorithm 
Effeciency  - the time and space.....

Time - how much processing time it takes in the cpu

Complexity - how much memory does it takes up


RULES OF EVALUATING COMPLEXITY 

- Think of a name (n) for the size of input 

- If we have many like arr1 and arr 2 name them n and m respectively

- For consucutive statements  add time complexity for each

- For branching statements if/else 
Use the worst case scenario

  - For loops use the maximum number of loop can run by  the complexity  of the work inside the loop

 - Simlify: eliminate constant multiples withn parenthesis 






THE BIG O FAMILY

1. O(1)



- This is constant no matter how much data is given to  it

2. O(n) 

- depends on the number of inputs n

A straight line
